# project-dog-classification

## Project Overview 
In this project, I builded a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog,  algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
